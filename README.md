# auto-save-email

This is a script that I modified originally from Chris Carter's script found here: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/Save-Email-from-Outlook-to-3abf1ff3.

I modified the script such that it would dynamically parse my inbox for certain subject lines, and would then save those 
emails into folders that exist for their respective ID numbers.

The script is written to be used in Microsoft PowerShell. 

*For the $file variable, I've taken out the path to my folder for security purposes.*
